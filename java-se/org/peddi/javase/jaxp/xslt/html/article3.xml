        <PARA>In addition to the inline tag
            in the heading,
            this section defines the term
            <DEF>inline</DEF>,
            which literally means "no line break".
            It also adds a simple link to the main page
            for the Java platform
            (<LINK>http://java.sun.com</LINK>),
            as well as a link to the
            <LINK target="http://java.sun.com/xml">
                XML </LINK>
            page.
